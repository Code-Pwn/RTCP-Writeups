The challange loads up a Unity Web Player. It has a number of characters you can swap through. There are options to view diffrent sprite animations. Looks like a chracter creater for a game. But we want just want the goblin sprite.

First thing to do is open up the source code of the page. There you can find "Builds.js" 
Go to it's URL and you get the file. Open it and you find refrences to a number of of other 
files that Unity will load up. We are intereseted in the "Builds.data.unityweb" This file 
should contain all the assets used. Extracting them can be a bit tricky. The file is 
gzipped and can be unzipped. THis gets you some plain text but not an easyway to get the 
files.

Fortuntaly, there is a tool called DevXUnityUnpackerTools. This allows us to browse the contents of the file. Little looking and we find "goblin.png" Select it and we can "save as png" Hit that and now we just need to has the image with md5.
