__**Description**__
I was asked to beta-test this game, but it's so incomplete, it's kind of
doesn't even have a goal... The developer said there's a flag, though,
so I guess I'll just leave you to it!

In Progress (400)

**Hint2:**Have you ever played Skyrim? Well, you don't need a horse
for this one.


__**Solution**__

Sweet! An unfinished game to break! Download the file and start up the game. 
We got some basic controls. Left and right moment and a jump button. 
So off we go following the signs giving us directions. A cliff we shouldn't 
jump off? Lets do it. Ah goblins to kill us great. Well it seems they can't
hurt us and we can't hurt them

At this point I fire up cheat engine and start looking for something useful.
Due probably in part to my current lack of experience with Cheat Engine,
I struggled to find something but I also managed to wander the opposite
direction of the signs and found another cliff. I jumped off of course. No
I didn't die. I instead discovered some patchy ground that lead to wall with
what appeared to be doors in the air above it. I tried to get through them and
failed. However, I learned that the mountain before me was climbable. By
jumping and pressing the left arrow key I could stick myself in the wall so I
didn't fall but could still jump out and up again. 

I worked my way to the top of the mountain and found a diamond which I couldn't
interact with. There was also another cliff. I did the natural thing and jumped.

The player character fell off into darkness and after a few seconds the flag
appeared on the screen.
